My answers for the 2018 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

## To Do

* For part 2 of day 2, it might be more efficient to construct a binary search tree.
* The solution for day 7 has quite some duplication.
* The MinMax struct from day 10 can be generalized further and then moved to the helpers. (Or maybe such a lib already exists?)
