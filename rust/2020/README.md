My answers for the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## To Do

* For day 19, I feel the solution could be way faster. It currently runs in about 200ms on my laptop, but I think it can be done in less than 100ms.
* For day 20, the solution can be cleaned up a little bit.
  * Actually mark the dragons in the image.
  * Maybe do something clever, so not all rotations have to be marked explicitely.
